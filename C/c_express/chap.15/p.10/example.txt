I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002
We were only eleven
But acting like grownups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing love is forever and ever
Well, I guess that was true
